ok so for Cutscenes there needs to be a formats so it isn't hardcoded
Also needs to take into account multiple choices


right bar with a list of events
drop down menu showing different scenes
a create scene button
delete scene button
relocate button over each event which prompts the line to move it to
use wasd to move camera position
button to add/remove character (uses character library)
when clicking on an event it opens a menu on the left side 
the menu has info related to the event
MOVECHAR:
- needs char selected (dropdown)
- two inputs for x & y + a button to click on position on map
MOVECAM:
- two inputs for x & y + a button which sets values to current camera
- another input for zoom + a button which sets value to current zoom
- camera movement time in seconds
- possibly an easing time




BATTLING CONTROLS

wasd controls the cursor obv
Space is select for cursor
E opens/closes the attack list

OR (BETTER)

Move Phase:
wasd move location
Q & E to swap current character
Space confirm move
Attack Phase:
Q & E swap current attack
wasd move cursor
Space confirm attack



ANIMATIONS HOW THEY WORK

so i need a stepAnim() for players
and a setAnim(name, speed, loop) speed is a multiplier, the actual speed is set in bigg.
{settings: {offset: {x: 0, y: 0}, frameSize: 64, width: 6}, walk: {speed: 2, start: 5, end: 15}}
  speed: how many frames each image stays on screen
  start: start frame
  end: try and guess bruh
  offset: offset if person making spritesheet is mentally unwell
  frameSize: size of each frame in pixels
  width: how many frames in a row





Cutscene Creator:

scene init has import character and set initial world
dropdown menu to select character for deleting/init position
canvas on the right for event list. Each event has up/down/delete/set position
  Click on event for settings
